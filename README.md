This email system project is an excellent advanced Java project that demonstrates enterprise-level communication infrastructure. Let me create a comprehensive implementation that showcases the core components of an email system.I've created a comprehensive email system implementation that demonstrates the core concepts you outlined. Here's what the system includes:

## Key Features

**1. Core Email Infrastructure:**
- **Email Class**: Represents email messages with metadata (sender, recipient, subject, body, timestamp, status)
- **Message ID Generation**: Unique identifier for each email using MD5 hashing
- **Email Status Tracking**: DRAFT, SENT, DELIVERED, READ, FAILED

**2. SMTP Server Implementation:**
- **Multi-threaded Server**: Handles multiple concurrent connections
- **SMTP Protocol Support**: Implements core SMTP commands (HELO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, DATA, QUIT)
- **Email Processing**: Parses incoming emails and routes them to recipients
- **Mailbox Management**: Stores emails for each user

**3. POP3 Server Implementation:**
- **Email Retrieval**: Allows clients to download emails
- **Authentication**: Basic user authentication system
- **POP3 Commands**: STAT, LIST, RETR, USER, PASS, QUIT
- **Message Status Updates**: Marks emails as read when retrieved

**4. Email Client GUI:**
- **Inbox Management**: View received emails in a table format
- **Email Composition**: Send new emails with validation
- **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refresh inbox every 5 seconds
- **Email Display**: Read full email content with proper formatting

**5. Advanced Features:**
- **Thread Pool Management**: Efficient handling of concurrent connections
- **Email Validation**: Regex-based email address validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling throughout
- **Sample Data**: Pre-loaded sample emails for demonstration

## Technical Implementation

**Protocols Used:**
- **SMTP (Port 2525)**: For sending emails
- **POP3 (Port 1100)**: For retrieving emails
- **HTTP compatibility**: Can be extended to use port 80

**Security Features:**
- **Connection Management**: Proper socket handling and cleanup
- **Input Validation**: Email format validation and sanitization
- **Thread Safety**: Concurrent access protection using synchronized methods

**Architecture Benefits:**
- **Modular Design**: Separate classes for different responsibilities
- **Scalable**: Thread pool can handle multiple simultaneous connections
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new features like attachments, encryption, etc.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main method to start both servers
2. **Email Clients**: Two client windows will open for demo users
3. **Send Emails**: Use the "Compose" tab to send emails between users
4. **View Emails**: Check the "Inbox" tab to see received messages
5. **Real-time Updates**: Inbox refreshes automatically

This implementation showcases enterprise-level email system concepts including proper protocol handling, concurrent processing, and a user-friendly interface. The system can be extended with additional features like SSL/TLS encryption, attachment support, spam filtering, and database persistence.

The project demonstrates advanced Java concepts including networking, threading, GUI development, and protocol implementation - making it an excellent learning project for understanding how email systems work at a fundamental level.
